## What is it?

The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a free, open-source platform developed by the Center for Open Science that supports the entire research lifecycle. OSF provides tools for project management, collaboration, data storage, pre-registration, and sharing of research materials. It serves as a central hub where researchers can manage their projects, store files, connect external services, and make their work openly accessible to the research community.

## What can it be used for?

OSF can be used for:

- **Project management**: Organize research projects with hierarchical folder structures and component organization
- **Collaboration**: Share projects and files with team members, assign different permission levels
- **File storage**: Store research files with version control and backup functionality (up to 50GB per private project)
- **Pre-registration**: Create time-stamped pre-registrations of study protocols and analysis plans
- **Data and code sharing**: Make research materials openly accessible with permanent DOIs
- **Integration**: Connect external services like GitHub, Google Drive, Dropbox, Zotero, and Mendeley
- **Preprint sharing**: Upload and share preprints through affiliated preprint servers
- **Wiki documentation**: Create project documentation and protocols using the built-in wiki
- **Research transparency**: Implement open science practices throughout the research workflow

## How to request access

OSF is freely available to all researchers worldwide. No institutional access request is needed:

1. **Create account**: Go to [https://osf.io](https://osf.io) and sign up with your email address
2. **VU affiliation**: When creating your account, you can indicate your VU Amsterdam affiliation
3. **Institutional login**: You may also be able to log in using your institutional credentials through ORCID or other identity providers

## Are there costs involved?

OSF is completely free to use for all researchers. There are no costs for:

- Account creation and maintenance
- File storage (up to 50GB per private project, unlimited for public projects)
- Collaboration features
- Pre-registration services
- DOI assignment for public projects
- Integration with external services

## Getting started

### Creating your first project

1. **Sign up**: Create your OSF account at [osf.io](https://osf.io)
2. **Create project**: Click "Create new project" from your dashboard
3. **Project details**: Add a title and description for your research project
4. **Privacy settings**: Choose whether to make your project public or keep it private
5. **Add collaborators**: Invite team members and assign appropriate permissions (read, write, admin)

### Organizing your project

#### Project structure
- **Components**: Create sub-projects for different aspects of your research (e.g., Data, Analysis, Materials)
- **Folders**: Organize files within each component using folder structures
- **Tags**: Add tags to make your project more discoverable

#### File management
- **Upload files**: Drag and drop files directly into your project
- **Version control**: OSF automatically tracks file versions when you upload updates
- **File linking**: Link to files stored in connected external services

### Pre-registration

OSF provides robust pre-registration capabilities:

1. **Choose template**: Select from various pre-registration templates (PSA, AsPredicted, etc.)
2. **Complete registration**: Fill out your study protocol, hypotheses, and analysis plan
3. **Submit**: Create a time-stamped, unchangeable registration before data collection
4. **Share**: Make your pre-registration public immediately or after a specified embargo period

## How does it work/more detailed instructions

### Project management features

#### Collaboration tools
- **User permissions**: Assign read, write, or admin access to different collaborators
- **Activity tracking**: Monitor all project activities through the project log
- **Comments**: Add comments to files and project components for team communication

#### External integrations
Connect your OSF project to external services:
- **GitHub**: Link code repositories and sync commits
- **Google Drive, Dropbox, Box**: Connect cloud storage accounts
- **Zotero, Mendeley**: Link reference management libraries
- **Figshare, Dataverse**: Connect to external data repositories

#### Version control and backup
- **File versions**: Access previous versions of any uploaded file
- **Change tracking**: See what was changed, when, and by whom
- **Backup**: All files are backed up and stored on multiple servers

### Making research public

#### Publishing workflow
1. **Prepare materials**: Organize all research files, data, and documentation
2. **Add metadata**: Include comprehensive descriptions, tags, and contributor information
3. **Choose license**: Select appropriate licensing for your materials (CC0, CC BY, etc.)
4. **Make public**: Change project visibility from private to public
5. **Get DOI**: Public projects automatically receive a permanent DOI

#### FAIR principles compliance
OSF supports FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles:
- **Findable**: Projects are indexed and searchable, with permanent DOIs
- **Accessible**: Public projects remain permanently accessible
- **Interoperable**: Supports multiple file formats and metadata standards
- **Reusable**: Clear licensing and detailed documentation support reuse

### Best practices

#### Project organization
- Use clear, descriptive project and component names
- Create a logical folder structure that others can understand
- Include a README file explaining your project structure
- Use consistent file naming conventions

#### Documentation
- Add detailed descriptions to projects, components, and files
- Use the wiki feature to document protocols and procedures
- Include information about software versions and analysis environments
- Document data collection procedures and variable definitions

#### Collaboration
- Set up appropriate permission levels for different team members
- Use the comment system for file-specific discussions
- Maintain an active project log by using descriptive commit messages
- Regular team check-ins to ensure everyone understands the project structure
