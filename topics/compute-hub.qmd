## What is it?
The [VU Compute Hub](https://hub.compute.vu.nl) is a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) instance hosted by IT at the VU. It allows you to run a number of common analysis tools on a central server. The Hub is mainly aimed at creating environments for Student Courses, but is available for VU Researchers as well.

### Available tools
The following applications are currently available: Jupyter Notebooks, MATLAB, STATA and R Studio.

## What can it be used for?
The VU Compute Hub is a great environment when your analysis takes too much time for a laptop. It allows you to use the graphical tools you are familiar with in an environment with more compute power where you can leave your script running until it is finished. 

Since every researcher can just log in the barrier to entry is very low. 

Be aware the service is mainly aimed at education. If your scripts use a lot of resources it might be time for you to start using a High Performance Computing (HPC) environment: [BAZIS](./bazis.qmd) at the VU or the national supercomputer [Snellius](./snellius.qmd). Please contact [IT for Research](mailto:itvo.it@vu.nl) to discuss the best options.

## How to request access
You do not need to request access. 

## Are there costs involved?
There are no costs involved.

## Getting started
Just go to [hub.compute.vu.nl](https://hub.compute.vu.nl), click the server with the least load, login with your VUnetID and select the environment you would like to use.
