## What are the CARE Principles?

The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance are a set of guidelines that complement the FAIR principles by focusing on people and purpose in data management, particularly for Indigenous data. CARE stands for Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics. These principles were developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance to ensure that data practices support Indigenous communities' self-determination and promote equitable outcomes for Indigenous peoples.

While originally developed for Indigenous data, the CARE principles have broader applicability to research involving any communities or populations, particularly those that have been historically marginalised or disadvantaged. They emphasise community engagement, ethical responsibility, and the importance of ensuring that data use benefits the communities from which data originate.

## The CARE principles

The CARE principles encompass four key areas:

### Collective Benefit
Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data. This is specified in the following ways:

- **Inclusive development and innovation**: Data should support Indigenous innovation and generate value for Indigenous communities. Use and reuse of data *by* Indigenous Peoples should be enabled and stimulated by governments and research institutions.
- **Community value creation**: Data ecosystems should be designed to support Indigenous communities' self-determination and collective benefit, and to foster transparency, engagement and understanding between Indigenous Peoples and their (local) governments and policymakers.
- **Equitable outcomes**: Data use should promote equitable outcomes for Indigenous peoples and communities and contribute to Indigenous aspirations for wellbeing.

### Authority to Control
- **Rights recognition**: Indigenous peoples have inherent rights and interests relating to Indigenous data
- **Governance frameworks**: Indigenous communities should have authority over data governance frameworks affecting their communities
- **Protocol development**: Indigenous communities should establish their own data governance protocols and standards
- **Decision-making power**: Indigenous peoples should have the authority to control access to and use of their data
- **Self-determination**: Data governance should support Indigenous self-determination and sovereignty

### Responsibility
- **Respectful relationships**: Researchers and data users should build respectful, reciprocal relationships with Indigenous communities
- **Community engagement**: Meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities throughout the research lifecycle
- **Cultural competence**: Understanding and respecting Indigenous cultures, values, and knowledge systems
- **Capacity building**: Supporting Indigenous communities' data capacity and infrastructure development
- **Accountability**: Taking responsibility for how research and data use affects Indigenous communities

### Ethics
- **Rights-based approach**: Data practices should align with Indigenous rights as outlined in international declarations
- **Harm minimization**: Data use should minimize harm and risks to Indigenous communities
- **Justice and equity**: Data practices should promote justice and equity for Indigenous peoples
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Respecting Indigenous cultural protocols and ways of knowing
- **Transparency**: Open, honest communication about research purposes, methods, and outcomes

### Implementation Examples
- **Community-based participatory research**: Research designed and conducted in partnership with Indigenous communities
- **Indigenous data sovereignty**: Recognition of Indigenous peoples' right to control data about their communities
- **Culturally appropriate protocols**: Data collection and management methods that respect Indigenous cultural values
- **Benefit-sharing agreements**: Formal agreements ensuring research benefits flow back to participating communities
- **Indigenous research methodologies**: Using research approaches developed by and for Indigenous communities
