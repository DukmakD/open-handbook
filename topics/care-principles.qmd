## What are the CARE Principles?

The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance are a set of guidelines that complement the FAIR principles by focusing on people and purpose in data management, particularly for Indigenous data. CARE stands for Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics. These principles were developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance to ensure that data practices support Indigenous communities' self-determination and promote equitable outcomes for Indigenous peoples.

While originally developed for Indigenous data, the CARE principles have broader applicability to research involving any communities or populations, particularly those that have been historically marginalised or disadvantaged. They emphasise community engagement, ethical responsibility, and the importance of ensuring that data use benefits the communities from which data originate.

## The CARE principles

The CARE principles encompass four key areas:

### Collective Benefit
Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data. This is specified in the following ways:

- **Inclusive development and innovation**: Data should support Indigenous innovation and generate value for Indigenous communities. Use and reuse of data *by* Indigenous Peoples should be enabled and stimulated by governments and research institutions.
- **Community value creation**: Data ecosystems should be designed to support Indigenous communities' self-determination and collective benefit, and to foster transparency, engagement and understanding between Indigenous Peoples and their (local) governments and policymakers.
- **Equitable outcomes**: Data use should promote equitable outcomes for Indigenous peoples and communities and contribute to Indigenous aspirations for wellbeing.

### Authority to Control
Indigenous Peoples’ must have the right and authority to control their data and how they and information about them are represented in data. This is specified further as follows:

- **Rights recognition**: Indigenous Peoples have inherent rights and interests relating to Indigenous data and to individual and collective Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC).
- **Data for governance**: Indigenous Peoples have the right to (access to) data that empower their world-view, self-determination and self-governance.
- **Governance of data**: Indigenous Peoples have the right to determine what happens to their data.

### Responsibility
Those working with Indigenous data are responsible for showing that the data use supports and benefits Indigenous Peoples. They also have to be transparent about *how* the data are used. This is specified as follows:

- **Positive relationships**: Researchers and data users should build respectful, trusted and reciprocal relationships with Indigenous Communities.
- **For expanding capability and capacity**: Those working with the data should support Indigenous Peoples' capacity to work with data capability to develop infrastructure for data.
- **For Indigenous languages and worldviews**: Those working with the data should provide resources that enable generating and collecting data in Indigenous languages and cultural contexts.

### Ethics
Indigenous People's rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern for data users during the entire data lifecycle. This is specified in the following points:

- **Minimising harm and maximising benefit**: Data use should minimise harm and risks to Indigenous communities and should be collected and used according to Indigenous Peoples' frameworks. Benefits should be assessed based on Indigenous Peoples' perspective.
- **Justice**: Data practices should promote justice and representation for Indigenous peoples
- **Future use**: Data governance must include considerations for future use and prevent potential future *mis*use of data according to the Indigenous People's frameworks.

### Implementation Examples
- **Community-based participatory research**: Research designed and conducted in partnership with Indigenous communities
- **Indigenous data sovereignty**: Recognition of Indigenous peoples' right to control data about their communities
- **Culturally appropriate protocols**: Data collection and management methods that respect Indigenous cultural values
- **Benefit-sharing agreements**: Formal agreements ensuring research benefits flow back to participating communities
- **Indigenous research methodologies**: Using research approaches developed by and for Indigenous communities
