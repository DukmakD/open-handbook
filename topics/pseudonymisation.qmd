## What is Pseudonymisation?

Pseudonymisation is the process of replacing direct identifiers in personal data with pseudonyms (artificial identifiers) while maintaining the ability to re-identify individuals when necessary through additional information kept separately. Under GDPR, pseudonymisation is considered a technical and organizational measure that can reduce privacy risks while allowing data to remain useful for research purposes. Unlike anonymisation, pseudonymisation is reversible - the original identities can be recovered when the pseudonym key is available.

Pseudonymisation provides a middle ground between using identifiable data and complete anonymisation. It allows researchers to protect participant privacy during routine data handling while maintaining the possibility of re-identification for specific purposes such as linking additional data, contacting participants for follow-up studies, or handling data correction requests. This makes pseudonymisation particularly valuable for longitudinal research and studies requiring future participant contact.

## Examples

Pseudonymisation involves various techniques for replacing identifying information:

### Direct Identifier Replacement
- **Name pseudonyms**: Replacing real names with study IDs, participant codes, or generated pseudonyms
- **Address codes**: Substituting addresses with geographic codes or area identifiers
- **Contact information**: Replacing email addresses and phone numbers with study contact codes
- **Account identifiers**: Substituting usernames and account numbers with research identifiers
- **Document references**: Replacing personal document numbers with study reference codes

### Systematic Pseudonym Generation
- **Sequential numbering**: Assigning participants sequential study numbers (P001, P002, etc.)
- **Random identifiers**: Using randomly generated alphanumeric codes for each participant
- **Coded systems**: Developing systematic coding schemes based on study design requirements
- **Hash functions**: Using cryptographic hash functions to generate consistent pseudonyms
- **Database keys**: Using database-generated unique identifiers as pseudonyms

### Key Management Approaches
- **Separate key files**: Maintaining pseudonym-to-identity mapping in separately secured files
- **Split custody**: Dividing pseudonym keys between multiple trusted parties
- **Encrypted storage**: Storing pseudonym keys in encrypted form with controlled access
- **Time-limited keys**: Creating pseudonym systems with planned key destruction dates
- **Multi-layer pseudonymisation**: Using nested pseudonym systems for additional security

### Contextual Pseudonymisation
- **Temporal pseudonyms**: Using different pseudonyms for different time periods or study phases
- **Role-based pseudonyms**: Different pseudonyms for different aspects of participant involvement
- **Cross-study linkage**: Pseudonym systems that enable linking data across multiple studies
- **Hierarchical schemes**: Pseudonym systems reflecting organizational or family relationships
- **Domain-specific codes**: Pseudonyms tailored to specific research domains or data types

### Quasi-identifier Treatment
- **Date shifting**: Moving dates by random but consistent amounts for each participant
- **Geographic generalization**: Reducing geographic precision while maintaining pseudonym consistency
- **Demographic clustering**: Grouping similar demographic characteristics under shared codes
- **Categorical recoding**: Replacing specific values with broader category codes
- **Range substitution**: Using ranges instead of exact values while maintaining individual linkability
