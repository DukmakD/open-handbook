## What is it?
DataverseNL is an Open Access dataset archiving and publication platform used by various institutions. The VU has a section for each faculty to archive their datasets.
 
DataverseNL helps the researcher make their data "[FAIR](../topics/fair-principles.qmd)" by providing a solution that enables data discovery and sharing (i.e., findable, accessible). In addition, it facilitates the use of metadata, contributing to data interoperability and reusability. DataverseNL provides a platform for the implementation of standard workflows that can ensure metadata quality satisfying [VU policy requirements](../topics/research-data-and-software-management-policy.qmd) for data archiving and publication. Many research institutions and funding organisations (such as NWO and ZonMw) require researchers to make their data FAIR.
 
DataverseNL is open source software developed and maintained by [Harvard University]( https://dataverse.org/). The Dutch version is hosted by [DANS]( https://dans.knaw.nl/en/data-services/dataversenl/).
 
## What can it be used for?
 
DataverseNL is a simple method to archive and publish datasets. Through the platform it becomes very easy to share data and documents from your research. The platforms generates a webpage and DOI which enables increased visibility and quick references to your dataset. It is possible to make files within your dataset only accessible on request. This makes it a good solution for non-sensitive datasets. 
 
### Data storage
DataverseNL is a Cloud storage solution that can be used for small to large datasets. The datasets are preserved through backups copies of the data.
 
### Data sharing
Through the generated DOI you can make your dataset easy to find and access. You can reference it in your publications and through your profile page on the [VU CRIS](https://research.vu.nl/) (Current Research Information System).
 
### Sensitive data
Although DataverseNL is meant for Open Access datasets, it is possible to restrict access to particular files. This means it is possible to archive medium sensitive (anonymised) data.
 
### Metadata
You can add descriptive metadata to a dataset draft in DataverseNL. After publication of the dataset it is still possible to alter the metadata, but this will result in a new version of the dataset. If metadata fields are missing a request can sent to SURF to add these fields. The requirement for this change is that the added metadata fields are part of an internationally recognised dataset metadata scheme. 
 
## How to request access
DataverseNL is available for everyone. Anyone can gain access to the datasets by creating an account in DataverseNL, unless the dataset contains restricted files. In this case the contactperson for the dataset needs to grant access in order for others to use the data.
 
## Are there costs involved?
The costs for archiving datasets for the required period stated in the [Research Data and Software Management Policy]( https://rdm.vu.nl/guides/policies-supporting-vision-open-science.html) are currently covered through the Cost Recharge Model (KDM). The details can be found in the [Research Archiving & Storage Cost Model](https://vu.nl/en/employee/research-data-support/research-archiving-storage-cost-model). 
 
## Getting Started
