## What is it?

Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) is a cloud-based desktop and application virtualization service provided by Microsoft Azure. At VU Amsterdam, AVD provides researchers with access to a virtual Windows environment that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. This service enables researchers to access specialized software, computing resources, and secure environments for data processing without requiring physical installation on their personal devices.

## What can it be used for?

Azure Virtual Desktop can be used for:

- **Access to specialized software**: Use licensed software that may be expensive or unavailable for personal installation
- **Secure data processing**: Work with sensitive or confidential data in a controlled, institutional environment
- **Cross-platform access**: Access Windows applications and environments from Mac, Linux, or mobile devices
- **Remote collaboration**: Share virtual desktop sessions with team members for collaborative work
- **High-performance computing**: Access virtual machines with enhanced computational capabilities
- **Standardized environments**: Work in consistent, pre-configured research environments
- **Compliance requirements**: Meet data security and privacy requirements for certain types of research
- **Software testing**: Test applications and workflows in isolated virtual environments
- **Teaching and training**: Provide students with consistent access to required software and resources
