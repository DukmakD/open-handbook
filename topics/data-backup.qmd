## Data Backup

**Too long, didn’t read**: ensure your data are in at least two and ideally three *independent* places.

### Why backup?

Hard drives fail, computers get stolen or lost, or you or someone else may accidentally delete your data etc. Therefore, to avoid data loss, backing up your data regularly is essential. Ideally, you should have your data stored in at least two, but ideally three different locations.

### OneDrive: A Simple Backup Solution 

The VU provides access to 1 TB of OneDrive storage for all employees and is the most convenient option for most users, as it automatically synchonizes your files to the cloud and provides a good solution to restore old files. Here’s how to set it up: 

1. On Windows, move your files to the OneDrive folder in your home directory. You can also set OneDrive to automatically synchonize your Documents folder and Desktop in the settings of your OneDrive application in your computer (Settings -> Manage backup). For Mac users: Install OneDrive and log in with your VU account, then proceed similar to Windows users.
2. Verify that your files are synced by visiting [onedrive.com](https://onedrive.com) (log in with your VU account). 

Restore Deleted Files: If you accidentally delete a file, you can restore your entire OneDrive to a previous date up to 28 days ago via [onedrive.com](https://onedrive.com) (Settings -> Restore your OneDrive). 

### Manual backups

In addition, it is highly advisable to manually copy your files (and especially critical files) to a folder, external hard drive, [SURFdrive](https://www.surf.nl/en/services/surfdrive) etcetera that is not affected by the OneDrive synchronization. In rare cases, it is possible for your data on OneDrive to be deleted. This is especially important when migrating your data, such as when updating your operating system to a new major version, or when you get a new computer. This means that you will temporarily only have one version of your files and thus no backup.

### Other solutions

In some cases, other solutions are preferred. For example, you can back up your code on GitHub, or save very large files (>100s GB) on external hard drives or [Yoda](https://yoda.vu.nl/site/). 

### Notes 

When your laptop and hard drive are in the same bag, the “backup” can easily get lost along with the primary data and there is thus no proper backup. 

These are just some tips, and you are ultimately responsible for your data and documents.
