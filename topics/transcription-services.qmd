## What is it?

Transcription services convert recorded audio and video content into written text format. At VU Amsterdam, researchers have access to two transcription solutions through institutional agreements: AmberScript (automated transcription software) and Transcript Online (professional transcription service). These services are particularly valuable for researchers conducting interviews, focus groups, observations, or other qualitative research methods that involve recorded content.

## What can it be used for?

Transcription services can be used for:

- **Interview transcription**: Convert recorded research interviews into text format for analysis
- **Focus group documentation**: Transcribe focus group sessions and group discussions
- **Lecture and presentation capture**: Convert recorded lectures, seminars, or presentations to text
- **Qualitative research**: Support qualitative data analysis by providing searchable text from audio/video recordings
- **Meeting documentation**: Transcribe research team meetings or stakeholder consultations
- **Multi-language content**: Handle recordings in different languages (depending on service capabilities)
- **Accessibility**: Create text versions of audio content for accessibility purposes
- **Data analysis preparation**: Prepare transcribed text for coding and analysis software
- **Archive creation**: Generate searchable text archives of recorded research activities

## How to request access

VU Amsterdam has established processing agreements with both transcription services:

### AmberScript (Automated transcription software)
1. **Direct access**: Create an account at [AmberScript](https://www.amberscript.com/en/) using your VU email address
2. **Institutional agreement**: Benefits from VU's processing agreement for GDPR compliance
3. **Account setup**: Follow the institutional signup process to ensure proper data processing coverage

### Transcript Online (Professional transcription service)

3. **Project setup**: Discuss project requirements and timelines with the service provider

For both services, researchers should verify the processing agreement covers their specific research requirements before uploading sensitive data.

## Are there costs involved?

Yes, both transcription services involve costs:

### AmberScript
- **Pricing model**: Pay-per-use based on audio/video duration
- **Cost factors**: Length of recording, language, turnaround time, and accuracy level selected

### Transcript Online
- **Professional service**: Higher cost but professional quality human transcription
- **Pricing factors**: Recording length, complexity, number of speakers, turnaround time
- **Specialized requirements**: Additional costs for technical terminology, multiple languages, or specialized formatting

### Cost considerations
- **Research budgets**: Include transcription costs in research project budgets
- **Faculty funding**: Check with your faculty about available funding for transcription services
- **Grant applications**: Include anticipated transcription costs in funding applications
- **Volume discounts**: Larger projects may benefit from negotiated rates

Contact your faculty's research administration for information about funding transcription services from faculty or project budgets.
