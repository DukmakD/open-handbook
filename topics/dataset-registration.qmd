## Registration & Findability

When you have finished finalizing a dataset and are ready to archive it, there are many options available. Depending on the research and choices made earlier the archive provides the option to fill in descriptive fields for a dataset. The descriptions in the archives often are automatically created using metadata standards like DataCite or Dublin Core, or some other type of standard. See also section [Metadata](../topics/metadata.qmd)

When registering a dataset in an archive it is important to use unique identifiers to allow for increased findability and easy attribution & citation. Examples of this are:

* **Personal names**: try to consistently use the same notation for all researchers and contributors that are included as authors
* **ORCID**: using a unique identifier like this for all authors is recommended. More information is [available here](https://libguides.vu.nl/orcid).
* **Institutional names**: avoid using different versions (or language versions) of participating Institutes/organisations and departments. In the case of VU Amsterdam the official written name is: Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. For each organisation or Institute that is included: try to make sure that the official name is used each time. [Search here](https://ror.org/search).
* **ROR**: using a unique identifier like this for all institutes and organisations is recommended. In the case of VU Amsterdam the ROR is [https://ror.org/008xxew50](https://ror.org/008xxew50). For other institutes and organisations [search here](https://ror.org/search).

Some archives also allow you to preregister your dataset. Examples are:

* [Open Science Framework](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/sections/360003624093-Create-Registrations) (OSF) Registration
* [Zenodo & registration](https://zenodo.org/deposit)

## Register your Dataset in PURE

Just like your publications, data that you have collected for your research constitutes research output, too. Therefore you are required to record your datasets in PURE. Your datasets can be of interest to others, which can in turn lead to new collaboration opportunities. Datasets recorded in PURE also appear in reports that are used for research evaluations. Even if access to your dataset is closed, you are required to register your dataset in PURE. It is a record of the research, data collection and analysis that you have carried out.

### Benefits of recording your dataset in PURE

* It increases the visibility and findability of your dataset
* It contributes to re-use and transparency
* It boosts your collaboration opportunities
* It counts towards research evaluations and assessments

### How to register your dataset in PURE?
