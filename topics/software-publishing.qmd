## What is Software Publishing?

Software publishing is the process of making research software publicly available and discoverable to the broader scientific community, typically through formal publication channels that provide permanent identifiers, peer review, and institutional recognition. Unlike simply sharing code on platforms like GitHub, software publishing involves formal documentation, quality assurance, and integration with scholarly publication systems that treat software as a legitimate research output deserving of academic credit and citation.

Software publishing encompasses both standalone software publications (dedicated software papers or repository deposits) and software components published alongside traditional research articles. It involves creating comprehensive documentation, ensuring software quality and usability, providing proper licensing, and making the software discoverable through appropriate metadata and indexing systems.

## Examples

Software publishing can take various forms:

### Standalone Software Publications
- **Software papers**: Dedicated articles describing software functionality, validation, and impact (e.g., Journal of Open Source Software, SoftwareX)
- **Repository deposits**: Direct deposit of software packages in specialized repositories with full documentation
- **Package registries**: Publication through language-specific package managers (PyPI, CRAN, npm) with proper documentation
- **Platform publications**: Release through platforms like GitHub/Zenodo integration with DOI assignment
- **Institutional repositories**: Publication through university or research institution software repositories

### Integrated Software Publications
- **Supplementary software**: Software accompanying journal articles as supplementary materials
- **Reproducible research packages**: Combined data, code, and analysis workflows published together
- **Interactive publications**: Executable papers where software is embedded in the publication itself
- **Protocol publications**: Detailed software protocols published in methods journals
- **Benchmark suites**: Published software for comparing and evaluating other tools

### Documentation and Metadata Requirements
- **Software description**: Clear explanation of purpose, functionality, and target users
- **Installation instructions**: Step-by-step setup and configuration guidance
- **Usage examples**: Tutorials, code examples, and sample datasets
- **API documentation**: Comprehensive function/method documentation for developers
- **Performance metrics**: Benchmarks, validation results, and comparison with alternatives
- **Licensing information**: Clear terms of use and distribution rights
- **Citation guidelines**: Instructions for proper academic citation
- **Contribution guidelines**: Processes for others to contribute improvements

### Quality Assurance Elements
- **Peer review**: Formal evaluation by domain experts and software engineering specialists
- **Testing documentation**: Evidence of comprehensive testing including unit, integration, and acceptance tests
- **Validation studies**: Scientific validation demonstrating software correctness and reliability
- **Usability evaluation**: Evidence that software is usable by intended audiences
- **Sustainability plan**: Strategy for long-term maintenance and community development

### Publication Metadata
- **Persistent identifiers**: DOIs, ORCIDs, and other permanent identification systems
- **Version control**: Clear versioning scheme linking published versions to development history
- **Dependencies**: Comprehensive documentation of software and hardware requirements
- **Contributors**: Complete attribution of all contributors with appropriate credit
- **Funding acknowledgments**: Recognition of financial support for software development
