## What is Pre-registration?

Pre-registration is the practice of publicly documenting study design, hypotheses, and analysis plans before collecting or analyzing data. This involves creating a time-stamped, unalterable record of research plans that is submitted to a registry before the research is conducted. Pre-registration helps distinguish between confirmatory research (testing pre-specified hypotheses) and exploratory research (generating new hypotheses from data), thereby reducing research bias and improving the credibility of scientific findings.

Pre-registration can apply to various types of studies including experiments, observational studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. The level of detail in pre-registration can vary from basic study outlines to comprehensive analysis plans that specify every statistical test to be performed.

## Examples

Pre-registration typically includes:

### Study Design Elements
- **Research questions and hypotheses**: Clear statement of what the study aims to test or investigate
- **Study design**: Experimental, observational, cross-sectional, longitudinal, etc.
- **Sampling plan**: Target population, sample size calculations, recruitment methods
- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: Who will and will not be included in the study
- **Randomization procedures**: How participants will be assigned to conditions (if applicable)

### Data Collection Procedures
- **Variables and measures**: All variables to be collected and how they will be measured
- **Data collection timeline**: When and how data will be collected
- **Quality control measures**: Steps to ensure data quality and reliability
- **Stopping rules**: Conditions under which data collection might be terminated early
- **Missing data handling**: How missing or incomplete data will be addressed

### Analysis Plans
- **Primary outcomes**: Main variables of interest and how they will be analyzed
- **Secondary outcomes**: Additional analyses that will be conducted
- **Statistical methods**: Specific tests, models, and procedures to be used
- **Multiple comparisons**: How multiple testing will be handled
- **Subgroup analyses**: Any planned analyses of specific subgroups
- **Sensitivity analyses**: Alternative analyses to test robustness of findings

### Registration Platforms
- **OSF Registrations**: Comprehensive platform with multiple templates
- **ClinicalTrials.gov**: Required for clinical trials in many jurisdictions
- **AsPredicted**: Simple, straightforward pre-registration platform
- **PROSPERO**: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- **AEA RCT Registry**: Economic research, particularly randomized controlled trials

## How does this help you in your research?

### Research Credibility and Transparency
- **Bias reduction**: Pre-registration prevents HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) and p-hacking
- **Transparent reporting**: Clear distinction between confirmatory and exploratory findings
- **Scientific integrity**: Demonstrates commitment to rigorous, unbiased research practices
- **Reproducibility**: Detailed plans enable others to reproduce your study design and analysis approach
- **Audit trail**: Complete record of research decisions made before seeing the data

### Methodological Benefits
- **Improved planning**: Forces careful consideration of study design and analysis before data collection
- **Statistical rigor**: Prevents data-driven analysis decisions that can inflate Type I error rates
- **Power optimization**: Sample size planning ensures adequate power to detect meaningful effects
- **Efficiency**: Reduces time spent on ad-hoc analysis decisions during the research process
- **Quality control**: Systematic planning improves overall study quality

### Publication and Career Advantages
- **Journal preferences**: Many journals now favor or require pre-registered studies
- **Registered reports**: Access to publication format where methods are peer-reviewed before data collection
- **Citation benefits**: Pre-registered studies may receive more citations due to higher perceived credibility
- **Grant competitiveness**: Funding agencies increasingly value pre-registered research approaches
- **Professional reputation**: Demonstrates methodological sophistication and commitment to best practices

### Collaboration and Team Benefits
- **Team alignment**: Ensures all collaborators agree on study design and analysis approach
- **Communication clarity**: Provides clear documentation of research plans for team members
- **Supervisor-student relations**: Helps supervisors and students agree on thesis research approaches
- **Multi-site coordination**: Enables consistent implementation across multiple research sites
- **Conflict prevention**: Reduces disagreements about analysis approaches after data collection

### Learning and Skill Development
- **Methodological thinking**: Develops systematic approach to research design and analysis planning
- **Statistical literacy**: Improves understanding of appropriate statistical methods and their assumptions
- **Research planning**: Builds skills in comprehensive research planning and project management
- **Scientific reasoning**: Encourages hypothesis-driven rather than data-driven research approaches
- **Meta-science awareness**: Develops understanding of factors that influence research quality and credibility

### Risk Management
- **Null result protection**: Pre-registration makes null results publishable and valuable
- **Scope creep prevention**: Helps maintain focus on original research questions
- **Resource optimization**: Better planning reduces wasted time and resources
- **Ethical compliance**: Supports ethical research by preventing selective reporting
- **Legal protection**: Provides documentation of research intentions for compliance purposes

### Open Science Contribution
- **Research transparency**: Contributes to broader open science movement
- **Knowledge synthesis**: Facilitates meta-analyses by providing complete information about studies
- **Research efficiency**: Prevents duplication of research efforts across the scientific community
- **Method sharing**: Enables others to build on and improve your methodological approaches
- **Scientific progress**: Contributes to more reliable and cumulative scientific knowledge

### Long-term Research Benefits
- **Research program coherence**: Helps develop systematic, programmatic research approaches
- **Method refinement**: Enables iterative improvement of research methods across studies
- **Theoretical development**: Supports theory-driven research and theoretical advancement
- **Research impact**: Pre-registered findings may have greater influence on policy and practice
