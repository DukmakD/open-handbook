Processing personal data requires a legal ground. One of the most common legal grounds used in scientific research is asking participants for their consent. 


##Consent as a legal ground

In order for consent to count as a valid legal basis, several conditions must be met. 

* Participants must be informed about the processing of their personal data **before** the processing takes place. 
* Consent must be given **freely**. Participants should not be pressured to participate and should have the genuine option to say no.
* Consent must be **specific** and **informed**. Participants should know for which purpose(s) their personal data are going to be used, why, by whom, and for how long.
* Consent must be **unambigious**. The agreement between the researcher and the participant must be expressed clearly, ideally in words that leave no doubt (i.e. by using clear and plain language). It is the responsibility of the researcher to ensure that there can be no misunderstanding to what the participant has consented to. 
* Consent cannot be implied. It should be achieved through an opt-in, a declaration or an **active** motion. Consent is not valid if it is given through silence, default selections (pre-ticked boxes), or by doing nothing.
* Consent must be **revocable**. A participant should be able to withdraw their consent at any time. If they do, their personal data can no longer be used for the research and should be deleted if possible. It is important that withdrawing consent is made as easy for the participant as providing consent. 


##How to ask for consent
Consent can be asked in various ways. You could ask participants to sign a document (online or on paper), ask them to give an affirmative statement via an audio- or video recording, or ask them to tick a box or answer an email. As a researcher you are free to choose from these options. However, you should be able to demonstrate that participants have given their consent as long as you are processing their data. Therefore, preference is generally given to ask consent via a form (online or on paper). When asking for consent via an online form, VU researchers are advised to use [Qualtrics](https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/qualtrics.html).
