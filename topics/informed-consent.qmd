Processing personal data requires a legal ground. One of the most common legal grounds used in scientific research is asking participants for their consent. 

##Consent as a legal ground
In order for consent to count as a valid legal basis, several conditions must be met. 
* Participants must be informed about the processing of their personal data **before** the processing takes place. 
* Consent must be given freely. Participants should not be pressured to participate and should have the genuine option to say no.
* Consent must be specific. Participants should know for which purpose(s) their personal data are going to be used for.
