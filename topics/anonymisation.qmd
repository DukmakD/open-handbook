## What is Anonymisation?

Anonymisation is the process of removing or modifying personal data in such a way that individuals can no longer be identified directly or indirectly, either by the data controller alone or in collaboration with any other party. In the context of GDPR, truly anonymised data is no longer considered personal data and therefore falls outside the scope of data protection regulations. Anonymisation is irreversible - once data is properly anonymised, it should be impossible to re-identify individuals even with additional information or computational resources.

Anonymisation differs from pseudonymisation in that it permanently removes the possibility of re-identification. While pseudonymisation replaces identifying information with pseudonyms but maintains the ability to re-identify individuals when necessary, anonymisation eliminates this possibility entirely. This makes anonymisation particularly valuable for research data sharing and long-term preservation, as anonymised data can be shared more freely without ongoing privacy concerns.

## Examples

Anonymisation techniques vary depending on data type and re-identification risks:

### Direct Identifier Removal
- **Names and addresses**: Complete removal of names, home addresses, and contact information
- **Identity numbers**: Removal of social security numbers, employee IDs, and student numbers
- **Account identifiers**: Deletion of usernames, email addresses, and account numbers
- **Biometric data**: Removal of fingerprints, facial recognition data, and DNA identifiers
- **Unique characteristics**: Elimination of rare or unique personal characteristics

### Quasi-identifier Treatment
- **Demographic generalization**: Age ranges instead of exact ages, postal code areas instead of specific addresses
- **Geographic aggregation**: City or region level instead of specific locations
- **Temporal generalization**: Month/year instead of specific dates, time ranges instead of exact times
- **Categorical grouping**: Professional sectors instead of specific job titles
- **Range specifications**: Income brackets instead of exact salaries

### Data Transformation Techniques
- **Statistical disclosure control**: Adding noise, data swapping, or micro-aggregation to prevent re-identification
- **k-anonymity**: Ensuring each individual is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other individuals
- **l-diversity**: Ensuring diversity in sensitive attributes within each equivalence class
- **t-closeness**: Maintaining similar distribution of sensitive attributes across the dataset
- **Differential privacy**: Mathematical framework for providing privacy guarantees through controlled noise addition

### Contextual Information Removal
- **Free-text sanitization**: Removal of identifying information from narrative text and comments
- **Metadata scrubbing**: Elimination of file metadata that might reveal identifying information
- **Timestamp modification**: Removing or generalizing precise timestamps that might enable re-identification
- **Network information**: Removal of IP addresses, device identifiers, and network traces
- **Behavioral patterns**: Modification of unique behavioral signatures that might enable re-identification

### Special Category Data Handling
- **Medical data**: Removal of rare diagnoses, specific treatment dates, and unique medical characteristics
- **Genetic information**: Elimination of genetic markers that could enable re-identification
- **Biometric measurements**: Removal or modification of unique physical measurements
- **Location traces**: Elimination of detailed location histories and movement patterns
- **Communication patterns**: Anonymisation of unique communication behaviors and preferences
