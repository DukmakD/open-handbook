## What is a Software Management Plan?

A Software Management Plan (SMP) is a document that outlines how research software will be developed, maintained, shared, and preserved throughout and after a research project. Similar to a Data Management Plan (DMP) for research data, an SMP provides a structured approach to managing research software as a valuable research output. It addresses key aspects of software development including documentation, version control, testing, licensing, sustainability, and long-term preservation.

A Software Management Plan helps researchers think systematically about software development practices and ensures that research software is developed using best practices that promote reproducibility, reusability, and collaboration.

## Examples

Software Management Plans typically address:

### Development and Documentation
- **Development methodology**: Agile, waterfall, or other approaches
- **Programming languages and frameworks**: Choice and justification of technologies
- **Code documentation**: Inline comments, API documentation, user manuals
- **README files**: Clear installation and usage instructions
- **Architecture documentation**: System design and component relationships

### Version Control and Collaboration  
- **Version control system**: Git, SVN, or other systems
- **Repository hosting**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or institutional repositories
- **Branching strategy**: How development branches are managed
- **Collaboration workflows**: How team members contribute code
- **Issue tracking**: Bug reports, feature requests, and project management

### Quality Assurance
- **Testing strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance testing
- **Continuous integration**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines  
- **Code review processes**: Peer review requirements and standards
- **Quality metrics**: Code coverage, performance benchmarks
- **Dependency management**: Handling of external libraries and dependencies

### Licensing and Legal
- **Software licensing**: Open source (MIT, GPL, Apache) or proprietary licenses
- **Contributor agreements**: Legal frameworks for external contributions
- **Intellectual property**: Ownership and usage rights
- **Third-party components**: Licensing compliance for dependencies
- **Export control**: Restrictions on software distribution

### Sharing and Publication
- **Release strategy**: When and how software versions are published
- **Distribution channels**: Software repositories, package managers, websites
- **Citation guidelines**: How others should cite the software
- **User support**: Documentation, forums, help systems
- **Community building**: Encouraging adoption and contributions

### Preservation and Sustainability
- **Long-term maintenance**: Plans for ongoing support and updates
- **Funding sustainability**: Resources for continued development
- **Code preservation**: Archival in long-term repositories like Zenodo
- **Legacy planning**: Migration paths and end-of-life procedures
- **Knowledge transfer**: Documentation for future maintainers

## Tools/services/resources related to concept provided by VU

VU Amsterdam provides several tools and services to support software management planning:

### Development and Version Control
- **GitHub**: VU researchers can use GitHub for code hosting and collaboration
- **Pure**: Required registration of research software per [VU policy](software-registration.qmd)
- **ADA HPC Cluster**: Development and testing environment for computational software
- **VU Compute Hub**: Jupyter environments for prototyping and development

### Documentation and Training
- **Research Data Management (RDM) Support**: Guidance on software management best practices via [rdm@vu.nl](mailto:rdm@vu.nl)
- **Software Carpentry**: Training in version control, testing, and development practices
- **FAIR Software recommendations**: Guidelines for making software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable

### Licensing and Legal Support  
- **Privacy Champions**: Faculty-level support for intellectual property and licensing questions
- **Legal advice**: Institutional support for software licensing and contributor agreements
- **Processing agreements**: For software that processes personal or sensitive data

### Preservation and Archiving
- **Zenodo integration**: For long-term preservation of software releases with DOIs
- **Pure registration**: Institutional requirement for software output registration
- **GitHub archiving**: Connection to preservation services for published code

### Quality Assurance Tools
- **Continuous Integration**: Support for automated testing pipelines
- **Code review tools**: Available through GitHub and other platforms  
- **Testing frameworks**: Access to testing tools across multiple programming languages
- **Documentation platforms**: Support for software documentation websites

## How does this help you in your research?

### Improved Software Quality
- **Reduces bugs and errors**: Systematic testing and review processes catch problems early
- **Enhances reliability**: Proper documentation and version control ensure consistent software behavior
- **Increases maintainability**: Well-planned software is easier to update and extend
- **Better performance**: Planning helps identify and address performance bottlenecks

### Enhanced Collaboration
- **Team coordination**: Clear processes enable effective teamwork on software projects
- **External contributions**: Well-managed projects attract contributions from other researchers
- **Code sharing**: Proper licensing and documentation make software reusable by others
- **Reproducible research**: Version-controlled, documented software supports reproducible results

### Research Impact and Recognition
- **Citable software**: Published software with DOIs can be cited like other research outputs
- **Professional reputation**: High-quality software demonstrates technical expertise
- **Career advancement**: Software development skills and published tools support career progression
- **Grant applications**: Well-managed software projects strengthen funding proposals

### Compliance and Risk Management
- **Policy compliance**: Meets VU requirements for research software management
- **Legal protection**: Proper licensing protects intellectual property rights
- **Data security**: Planning addresses security requirements for sensitive data processing
- **Audit readiness**: Documentation supports compliance with research integrity requirements

### Long-term Sustainability
- **Knowledge preservation**: Documentation ensures software can be maintained after personnel changes
- **Legacy planning**: Structured approach to software lifecycle management
- **Funding efficiency**: Better planning reduces development costs and rework
- **Technology evolution**: Planning helps adapt to changing technical requirements

### Research Reproducibility
- **Transparent methods**: Open, documented software enables others to verify and extend your research
- **Version tracking**: Clear versioning connects software states to research outputs
- **Environment documentation**: Specifications enable reproduction of computational environments
- **Automated workflows**: Scripted processes reduce manual errors and improve consistency

A Software Management Plan transforms ad hoc software development into a systematic, professional practice that enhances the quality, impact, and sustainability of your research software while supporting broader goals of open science and research reproducibility.
