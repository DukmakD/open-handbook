## What is a Repository?

A repository in research data management is a digital platform or service that provides secure, organized storage and access to research outputs including data, software, publications, and other scholarly materials. Repositories serve as centralized locations where researchers can deposit, preserve, share, and discover research outputs while ensuring long-term accessibility, proper attribution, and compliance with data management policies.

Research repositories range from general-purpose platforms that accept any type of research output to specialized repositories focused on specific disciplines, data types, or research communities. They typically provide features such as metadata management, version control, access controls, persistent identifiers, and integration with other research infrastructure.
