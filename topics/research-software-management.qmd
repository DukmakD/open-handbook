## What is Research Software Management?

Research Software Management (RSM) encompasses the systematic planning, development, maintenance, sharing, and preservation of software created or used for research purposes. RSM involves applying professional software development practices to research contexts, ensuring that research software is reliable, reproducible, sustainable, and contributes effectively to scientific knowledge. This includes managing the entire lifecycle of research software from initial conception through development, deployment, maintenance, and eventual archiving or retirement.

Research Software Management extends beyond basic coding practices to include project planning, quality assurance, documentation, version control, collaboration workflows, legal considerations, and long-term sustainability planning. It recognizes research software as a valuable research output that requires deliberate management to maximize its scientific impact and ensure its continued availability for future research.
