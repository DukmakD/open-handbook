IT for Research (ITvO) offers SciCloud, a service where server capacity can be purchased to support research applications. SciCloud virtual servers are easy to implement, easy to scale up and down and have competitive pricing based on agreed purchase. The virtual server can be placed in an internally or externally accessible network. Externally so internet-accessible services can be offered, or internally for better protection and access to VU IT services.

SciCloud is based on the European cloud middleware [OpenNebula (ONE)](https://opennebula.io/) and offers a service that allows users to quickly start with a virtual server based on available templates, or to upload one of their own virtual images. This concept is known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

## SciCloud functionalities 
- A virtual server with guaranteed CPU power and reserved RAM
- Full administrator (root) access, so that the server can be adapted to your own wishes
- A choice of templates with Windows and Linux operating systems. It is also possible to install your own OS, license and security permitting 
- Linking to shares on SciStor is possible
- Monitoring of operation and used capacity of the virtual server through a web portal
- Transparent cost, you pay a fixed monthly fee based on the configuration

## Storage 
By default, the virtual server is provided with 30 GB of storage capacity. Do you need more storage? Then a link with [SciStor](./scistor.qmd) storage is a possibile providing access to fast networked storage. ITvO can advise on this.

## Backup 
It is possible to take _snapshots_ or _clones_ of the virtual server yourself. This allows you to go back to a previously created configuration, if necessary. In addition, ITvO makes daily backups with which (on request) a virtual machine can be restored up to a month ago. 

## Requesting process 
Via form on [ServiceNow](https://services.vu.nl/esc), go to: IT > My work field > Research > SciCloud > Order SciCloud capacity

After you have requested a SciCloud virtual server, one of the IT for Research employees will schedule an interview after receipt of the application. Based on the wishes, personal advice and a cost estimate are then made. Purchase of virtual server capacity takes place according to standard building blocks, so that the server capacity is used optimally. This means that combinations of the following two options can be purchased: 

• Building Block 1: 1 CPU core with 2 GB RAM 
• Building Block 2: 1 CPU core with 4 GB RAM 

Different configurations are possible in consultation and based on availability.  
 
You are responsible for installing and maintaining any applications on the server yourself. On a consultancy basis, ITvO can assist in the configuration and optimization of the virtual server.
