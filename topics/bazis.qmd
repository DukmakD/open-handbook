## What is it

BAZIS is a High Performance Compute (HPC) Cluster for research hosted at VU Amsterdam. 

It consists of over a hundred compute nodes, some with GPUs. A number of these nodes are community resources that can be used by all VU researchers for free. Some research group have purchased their own compute nodes, so they have resources available exclusively for their own research. Jobs are run via a queueing system, so you might have to wait for others to be finished first.

As a researcher, you can make use of a large collection of tools, compilers and libraries.

BAZIS is maintained by IT for Research.

## What can it be used for?

Most researchers start out by running their analysis tools on their own laptop. The performance of a laptop is limited however. You might find you analysis takes up so much resources that your laptop becomes unusable for other tasks, or maybe tasks take so long that you have to find a way to keep your laptop running overnight. For example a lot of AI tasks, such as running Large Language Models (LLMs) require a dedicated GPU, which most laptops don't have meaning they run very slowly, or not at all.

A next step might be purchasing a Workstation with more performance and maybe a GPU which you can leave running overnight and during weekends, but the modern VU offices are not geared for workstations so that might not possible.

The point where your pc becomes unusable for your analysis workflow is when you should consider HPC. HPC nodes have a large amount of RAM, many processor cores and often multiple GPUs. HPC clusters work with a queueing system, meaning the system will wait until enough resources are available to run your job and it will run multiple jobs simultaneously so its resources are used optimally.

Be aware that it is generally not possible to run graphical desktop applications (such as R studio, SPSS or ARCGIS) on a HPC cluster. Your analysis needs to be able to run as a script that can be started from a Linux commandline. This means there is a learning curve to use HPC, especially if you are not used to a Commandline Interface (CLI) and scripting, but these are very useful skills to have as a researcher!

Note that if you feel you do not have the time to learn CLI skills there might be other options available such as [the VU Compute Hub](https://compute.vu.nl) or [SURF Research Cloud](./researchcloud.qmd) where you can run some graphical tools.
<!-- PV: Compute hub will get its own topic and there will be a topic or guide that lists the pros and cons of each compute solution  -->

At the moment the community partition does not include GPU resources. If you have tasks that need a GPU (such as Machine Learning) you can apply for access to the national HPC infrastructure [Snellius](./snellius.qmd) or consider [buying compute nodes]() 

## How to request access

A form to request an account can be found on ðŸ”’ [VU Service Portal](https://services.vu.nl/esc) under IT > My work field > Research > HPC Cluster Computing > New BAZIS HPC Cluster Computing.

## Are there costs involved?

The BAZIS cluster community nodes are free to use for VU researchers, resources are limited however. 

### Buying dedicated compute nodes

If your research projects require heavy usage of HPC you can consider spending part of your research budget to buy compute hardware for your group. Please contact ITvO for more information on what is possible.

## Getting started

There is a [guide with BAZIS tips & tricks](../guides/bazis-tips-and-tricks.qmd) in the Handbook.

Also take a look at the [SURF wiki Snellius pages](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Snellius), they contain a lot of information which applies to Bazis as well.

SURF organises regular "Introduction to Supercomputing" training sessions, these are free to attend for VU researchers. The course is aimed at using [Snellius](./snellius.qmd), but what you learn is applicable to BAZIS as well. Please consult the [SURF Agenda](https://www.surf.nl/en/agenda) for dates and registration.
