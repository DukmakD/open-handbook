## What is Research Data?

Research data is any information that has been collected, observed, generated, or created to validate original research findings. Research data encompasses the evidence on which research conclusions are based and includes both raw data collected during research activities and processed data that results from analysis, interpretation, or synthesis. Research data can exist in various formats and may be quantitative, qualitative, experimental, observational, or computational in nature.

The definition of research data is broad and context-dependent, varying across disciplines and research methodologies. What constitutes research data in one field may not be considered as such in another, but generally includes any systematically collected information that supports research conclusions and enables reproducibility and verification of research findings.
