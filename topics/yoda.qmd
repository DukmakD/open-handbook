## What is it?
Yoda is an application for institutions that supports Research Data Management (RDM) throughout the entire research cycle: from the safe and easy storage and sharing of data during the research process, to the sharing of data within research collaborations and ultimately to research data archiving and publication.

Yoda helps the researcher make their data "[FAIR](../topics/fair-principles.qmd)" by providing a solution that enables data discovery and sharing (i.e., findable, accessible). In addition, it facilitates the use of metadata, contributing to data interoperability and reusability. Yoda provides a platform for the implementation of standard workflows that can ensure metadata quality satisfying VU policy requirements for data archiving and publication. In addition, Yoda is built on [iRODS](https://irods.org) so it accommodates both researchers with data heavy requirements, as well as those seeking an accessible, user-friendly solution.

Yoda presents researchers a comfortable, easy-to-use solution for securely storing, sharing and organising their research data that follows the internationally adopted [FAIR](../topics/fair-principles.qmd) data principles. Many research institutions and funding organisations (such as NWO and ZonMw) require researchers to make their data FAIR. 

Project space in Yoda is basically a folder with group based access rights. Access restrictions are only set on the top level, meaning you need one Project Space per research project.

[Yoda is open source software](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/Yoda) developed and maintained by Utrecht University for the Yoda Consortium, of which VU Amsterdam is a member.  Yoda is hosted by SURF in their Amsterdam datacenter.

## What can it be used for?

The particular strength of Yoda lies in the fact that it is an all-in-one solution for managing your data during and after your project. It makes it easy to share and organize your data and add descripitve metadata at any moment. If (part of) your datasets needs to be published during or after your project this can be done by a few simple steps within Yoda itself, there is no need to upload your data to another platform. 

### Data storage
Yoda is a Cloud storage solution that can be used for small to very large datasets. The underlying [iRODS](https://irods.org) software ensures data integrity. Data in Yoda is backed up daily. 

### Data sharing
Once a new Yoda group has been created you can invite collaborators yourself. Researchers from national and international research institutes can login with their institutional account via SURF Research Access Management (SRAM). Collaborators from non-research institutes can create a free EduID NL account. 

### Sensitive data
Among other things the use of MFA with SRAM and hosting at SURF means Yoda is suitable for the storage and sharing of Highly Sensitive data. Please make sure to contact the Privacy Champion of your faculty to ensure if further measures are needed.

### Metadata
At any moment you can add metadata to a folder in Yoda via a web form. This means you can easily organize your data in such a way that it is not only ready for archiving and publishing but also findable for your collaborators. 

### Archiving
At any moment you can submit a data folder for Archiving in the Yoda **Vault**. Data in the Vault is read-only and cannot be deleted. To help make sure the dataset is suitable for archiving a Yoda datamanager (usually a data manager from you department or a faculty data steward) will need to approve your submission. Data in the Vault is directly accessible for your collaborators. Access for the Yoda datamanager ensures the data remains accessible on the long term.

### Publishing metadata and data
From the Yoda Vault you can submit the dataset for **publication**. A DOI is generated and registered with DataCite together with the metadata. DataCite ensures your dataset is findable and citable.

The DOI link will lead to a landing page in Yoda. The dataset itself can be Open, allowing direct download, Restricted, meaning other researchers need to contact you, or Closed, signalling the dataset is properly archived but not available for reuse. 

### Automated workflows
Since Yoda is build on iRODS you can also build (automated) workflows using iRODS Rules and Policies. 

## How to request access
Yoda is available for every VU researcher. If you need space to store data for your research project, [you can request it via the linked form](https://yoda.vu.nl/site/getting-started/requesting-space.html).

Once the project space has been created you can start to invite your collaborators.

## Are there costs involved?
The costs of storing data in Yoda are detailed on the ðŸ”’ [VU website](https://vu.nl/en/employee/research-data-support/research-archiving-storage-cost-model). 

## Getting Started

the VU Yoda website has practical information on the use of the Yoda for users [starting with Yoda](https://yoda.vu.nl/site/getting-started/index.html).

More information can be found on the [SURFsara Knowledge Base](https://servicedesk.surfsara.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Yoda+Hosting)

The [Yoda site of Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/Yoda) also contains useful information and is being redeveloped so it can also be used by VU Amsterdam and the other Consortium Partners.
