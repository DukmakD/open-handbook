## What is it?

DMPonline is an online platform that enables researchers to create, manage, and share Data Management Plans (DMPs). VU Amsterdam offers [DMPonline](https://dmponline.vu.nl/) as the institutional tool for writing Data Management Plans. The platform provides structured templates to help researchers address data collection, organization, storage, sharing, and preservation requirements throughout the research lifecycle.

## What can it be used for?

DMPonline can be used for:

- **Writing Data Management Plans**: Create comprehensive DMPs using various templates that meet funder and institutional requirements
- **Collaborative planning**: Work together with colleagues, advisors, and stakeholders on DMP development
- **GDPR compliance**: Register personal data processing activities to comply with VU Amsterdam's GDPR requirements
- **Funder compliance**: Use specific templates for different funding agencies (NWO, ZonMw, ERC)
- **Feedback and review**: Request feedback from faculty data stewards or RDM Support Desk colleagues
- **Template selection**: Choose from various templates including the VU template and funder-specific templates

## How to request access

VU Amsterdam researchers can access DMPonline directly at [https://dmponline.vu.nl/](https://dmponline.vu.nl/). No separate access request is required - you can log in using your VU credentials.

## Are there costs involved?

No, DMPonline is provided free of charge to all VU Amsterdam researchers as part of the university's research data management services.

### Selecting the right template

#### VU Template (Recommended)

For most research projects, we strongly recommend using the `VU DMP template 2021 (NWO & ZonMw certified) v1.4`. To select this template:

1. For the question on primary funding organisation, select the check box saying that no funder is associated with your plan
2. **Important**: Make sure you don't select the GDPR registration form if you're writing a full DMP

**Note**: Use the VU template even if you receive funding from NWO or ZonMw, as it is certified for these funders.

#### Funder-specific templates

If your funder requires a specific template:

1. In the field under `Select the primary funding organisation`, start typing the name of your funder
2. Select their specific template from the dropdown

### GDPR Registration

If your research involves personal data, you can use DMPonline to register your data processing activities:

- **Full DMP needed**: Use the `VU DMP template 2021 v1.4` - the information will automatically serve as your GDPR registration
- **Registration only**: Use the separate `VU GDPR registration form for research v1.1`

**Important**: Register before you start data collection if you use personal data in your research.

### Guidance and Support

- **Built-in guidance**: Each template section includes detailed explanations and example answers
- **Real-time help**: Context-sensitive guidance appears as you complete each section
