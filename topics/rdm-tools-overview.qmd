- **[AmberScript & Transcript Online](transcription-services.qmd)** - Automated and professional transcription services with VU processing agreements for GDPR compliance. Pay-per-use pricing.

## Processing & Analysis Phase

### High Performance Computing
- **[ADA HPC Cluster](ada.qmd)** - VU's on-campus computing cluster for multi-node computations. Community partition free for VU researchers, with options for dedicated hardware.
- **VU Compute Hub** - JupyterHub instance with analysis tools (Jupyter, MATLAB, STATA, R Studio, QGIS). Free access with low barrier to entry.
- **Snellius** - National supercomputer with VU contract allowing up to 1M SBUs for smaller projects.

### Cloud Computing & Virtual Environments  
- **SURF Research Cloud** - Portal for building virtual research environments with GPU access. Requires collaboration credentials and computing credits.
- **[Azure Virtual Desktop](azure-virtual-desktop.qmd)** - Microsoft cloud-based virtual Windows environments for specialized software access and secure processing.
- **SciCloud** - VU's Infrastructure-as-a-Service for virtual Linux/Windows servers. Good for web applications and 24/7 services.

## Storage & Backup Phase

### Active Research Storage
- **[Research Drive](research-drive.qmd)** - SURF cloud storage for collaboration with internal/external partners. Suitable for medium confidentiality data with folder-level access control.
- **[Yoda](yoda.qmd)** - All-in-one data management solution for entire research lifecycle. Suitable for high confidentiality data with built-in backup and archiving.
- **SciStor** - High-speed networked storage for large datasets. VU campus-hosted with direct connection to compute resources.

### Standard VU Storage
- **OneDrive** - Personal Microsoft 365 storage (not recommended for research data)
- **Teams** - Shared Microsoft documents with collaboration features (limited for research use)

## Sharing & Collaboration Phase

### Project Management & Collaboration
- **[Open Science Framework (OSF)](osf.qmd)** - Free platform for project management, collaboration, file storage, and pre-registration. 50GB per private project, unlimited for public projects.
- **GitHub** - Version control and code sharing with integration to other research tools.

### Secure File Transfer
- **SURF Filesender** - Send files up to 1TB to external partners with cloud-based secure transfer
- **Zivver** - Encrypted email and file transfer with attachments up to 5TB. Available to all VU employees.

## Archiving & Preservation Phase

### Research Data Repositories
- **[Yoda](yoda.qmd)** - Long-term archiving via Yoda Vault with permanent DOIs and multiple access levels
- **[DataverseNL](dataversenl.qmd)** - Open access dataset publishing with rich metadata support. Suitable only for non-personal data.

### Software & Code Repositories
- **GitHub** - Public code repositories with version control and collaboration features
- **Zenodo** - Research output publishing with permanent DOIs for software and data

## Publishing & Documentation Phase

### Research Output Registration
- **[Pure](pure.qmd)** - Required registration of all research datasets and software per VU policy. Public visibility and institutional compliance.
- **DataverseNL** - Open access publishing with comprehensive metadata and DOI generation
