## What is it?

Pure is VU Amsterdam's Current Research Information System (CRIS) that serves as the central repository for recording all research activities and outputs. All VU researchers can administer their research activities in [research.vu.nl/admin](https://research.vu.nl/admin/). Additionally the content and VU researchers are profiled on the VU research portal accessible at [research.vu.nl](https://research.vu.nl). Pure serves both as an internal management tool and as a public-facing platform that increases the visibility and discoverability of VU research.

## What can it be used for?

The following record types can be registered in Pure:
- Publications: This can be (journal) articles, books, conference contributions, working papers, preprints, PhD thesis*, patents, case notes and web publications.
- Activities: peer-review, editorial work, participating or organising an event, lectures, presentations, consultancy, PhD examinations, visiting external institutions, hosting external visitors and memberships of institutions based on academic expertise.
- Datasets: This can be raw research data or (tailored) datasets related to publications or projects.
- Software: This can be scripts or fully-fledged software programs.
- Prizes/Grants: This can be prizes given for research output or grants awarded for research proposals. 
- Press/Media: This can be the participations in various media forms as an expert or public engagement activities to promote (future) research.
- Projects: This can be all forms of projects in scope and size** and the ability to link all related research activities and output.

###Researcher profiles
VU Researchers can create and maintain comprehensive academic profiles by providing personal information, academic background and research focus and interests.

###Reporting
Pure can be used to report on all the content registered. For the annual VU report, visitations and the Open Access monitor, Pure reports are being used.  

###CV generation: 
Pure contains a tool to combine all the research activities and personal information into a CV document.

## How to request access

Access to Pure is automatically provided to all VU Amsterdam researchers and PhD students*.
*: Certain VU functions can have a research component to their workload, but if this is not a standard requirement, a Pure account is not automatically created.

## Are there costs involved?

No, Pure is provided free of charge to all VU Amsterdam researchers as part of the university's research infrastructure and support services.
