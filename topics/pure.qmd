## What is it?

Pure is VU Amsterdam's Current Research Information System (CRIS) that serves as the central repository for recording all research activities and outputs. All VU researchers can administer their research activities in [research.vu.nl/admin](https://research.vu.nl/admin/). Additionally the content and VU researchers are profiled on the VU research portal accessible at [research.vu.nl](https://research.vu.nl). Pure serves both as an internal management tool and as a public-facing platform that increases the visibility and discoverability of VU research.

## What can it be used for?

### Research output registration

The following record types can be registered in Pure:

- Publications: This can be (journal) articles, books, conference contributions, working papers, preprints, PhD theses[^1], patents, case notes and web publications.
- Activities: peer review, editorial work, participating in or organising an event, lectures, presentations, consultancy, PhD examinations, visiting external institutions, hosting external visitors and memberships of institutions based on academic expertise.
- Datasets: This can be raw research data or (curated) datasets related to publications or projects.
- Software: This can be scripts or fully-fledged software programmes.
- Prizes/Grants: This can be prizes given for research output or grants awarded for research proposals. 
- Press/Media: This can be the participations in various media forms as an expert or public engagement activities to promote (future) research.
- Projects: This can be all forms of projects in scope and size[^2] with the ability to link all related research activities and output. 
- Courses[^3]: This can be the development of courses or the presentation of these courses.

[^1]: VU-related PhD theses are registered in Hora Finita and when approved are automatically imported into Pure.
[^2]: Projects registered in the VU financial systems are automatically imported into Pure.
[^3]:  All the current courses are automatically imported into Pure.

### Researcher profiles
VU Researchers can create and maintain comprehensive academic profiles by providing personal information, academic background and research focus and interests.

### Reporting
Pure can be used to report on all the content registered. Pure reports are also used for the annual VU report, visitations and the Open Access monitor.  

### CV generation: 
Pure contains a tool to combine all the research activities and personal information into a CV document.

## How to request access

Access to Pure is automatically provided to all VU Amsterdam researchers and PhD candidates[^4].

[^4]: Certain VU functions can have a research component to their workload, but if this is not a standard requirement, a Pure account is not automatically created. Department heads can [request]( https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=b000b90f478aa110bfa46d72e36d4303) a Pure account and profile to be created for specific VU employees who create research output. 

## Are there costs involved?

No, there are no additional costs for VU Amsterdam researchers to use Pure.

## Getting started

### Accessing Pure

To work within Pure go to [research.vu.nl/admin](https://research.vu.nl/admin/workspace.xhtml). You can log in using your VUnetID and password.

### Setting up your profile

The VU has created an [online manual](https://libguides.vu.nl/manage-pure-profile) to set up your own profile in Pure.
You can also [link your ORCID profile to your PURE profile](https://libguides.vu.nl/orcid/register), which has as a benefit that publications registered in PURE are automatically added to your ORCID profile.

### Adding research outputs

The VU has created an [online manual](https://libguides.vu.nl/pure-managing-publications) to register research publication in Pure.

#### Datasets and software

The [RDSM policy]( https://rdm.vu.nl/guides/plan-and-design.html#policies-regulations) states that it is a requirement to register datasets and software when a research project has ended.
