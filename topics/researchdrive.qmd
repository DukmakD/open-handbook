## What is it?
[SURF Research Drive](https://www.surf.nl/en/services/research-drive) is an online storage and collaboration platform for research data. With Research Drive you can easily store and share files with other researchers, inside and outside the VU. You can access your data via a web interface or tools, from anywhere in the world. Research Drive is based on the Open Source [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com/) software and is hosted by SURF in their Amsterdam datacentre.

## What can it be used for?

### Data storage
Research Drive is a Cloud storage solution that can be used for small (a few GBs) to larger (a few TBs) datasets. Data is backed up daily. Because it is a cloud storage platform you will need to download data to your laptop to work with it. Research Drive makes this easy by using the ownCloud client allowing you to automatically sync the folders you want to work with.

### Data sharing
Only the initial creation of a new Projectfolder needs to be done by the administrator. After the initial setup the project owner can invite other internal and external collaborators himself, or delegate this task to others.

Research Drive is very flexible in setting access rights to folders and subfolders, making it ideal for use in collaborations with many participants.

### Sensitive data
Hosting at SURF and the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) makes Research Drive is suitable for storing Medium Sensitive data (High with extra measures).  Please make sure to contact the ðŸ”’ [Privacy Champion](https://vu.nl/en/employee/privacy-and-information-security/privacy-champions-information) of your faculty to check if further measures are needed.

### Data life-cycle
Research Drive is meant for data you are actively working with. We recommend archiving datasets that are no langer actively used, but can't be deleted, in [Yoda](./yoda.qmd). This ensures Research Drive is used optimally and costs are kept down for your research group and the VU.

### Collaborative tools
Within Research Drive, various apps and integrations are available to simplify the use and handling of research data, such as a tool to edit documents directly in the web interface. You can find a current list of app integrations on the [SURF User Knowledge Base](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102828080)

### SURFdrive replacement
Since both are based on ownCloud, Research Drive is very similar to SURFdrive, the main difference is that SURFdrive is personal storage while Research Drive is group based. Researchers looking for a new home for data currently on SURFdrive are encouraged to try Research Drive first, if you need any advice on how to best migrate your data please contact the [Research Support Desk](mailto:rdm@vu.nl)

## How to request access
A new Research Drive projectfolder can be requested via the form on ðŸ”’ [ServiceNow](https://services.vu.nl/esc), go to: Research Data Support > Research Data Management > Request Research Drive.

Once you have a projectfolder you can invite internal and external collaborators yourself.

## Are there costs involved?
The costs of storing data in Research Drive are detailed on the ðŸ”’ [VU website](https://vu.nl/en/employee/research-data-support/research-archiving-storage-cost-model). 


## Getting started
The SURF User Knowledge Base contains a number of [Tutorials](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Tutorials) on working with Research Drive.
