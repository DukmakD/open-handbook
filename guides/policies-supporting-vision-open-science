description: "As open as possible, as closed as necessary."

Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is strongly committed to the accessibility of research output, namely publications, data and software. They are important to the visibility, verifiability and reusability of research. To make accessible research output a reality, VU Amsterdam has developed a Research Data and Software Management Policy. This policy is based on a set of VU-internal, national and international policies, principles and regulations. This guide provides references and short explanations of these documents.

## Research Data and Software Management Policy

## VU Strategie 2020-2025
The Research Data and Software Management Policy follows the [VU Strategy](https://issuu.com/vuuniversity/docs/vu_instellingsplan-eng), in which VU Amsterdam endorses Open Science and FAIR data (see Section 5.1). More information relating to the VU Strategy can be found on the [Strategy page](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/strategy).

## Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity
Dutch scientists are required to comply with the [Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en/research-integrity). More information about this code of conduct and procedures for violations of academic integrity at VU Amsterdam is available on the page about [Academic Integrity](../topics/academic-integrity.qmd).

## FAIR Principles
The aim of the [FAIR Principles](../topics/fair-principles.qmd) is to guide researchers to make their data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.

## Research assessment criteria

### Strategy Evaluation Protocol (SEP)
In the Netherlands, research institutes and departments are being evaluated by the [Strategy Evaluation Protocol](https://storage.knaw.nl/2022-06/SEP_2021-2027.pdf) (SEP). One of the aspects that need to be addressed in every evaluation, is Open Science. The extent to which a research institute works openly, is evaluated based on:

* to which extent the research unit opens up its work to other researchers and societal stakeholders;
* whether the research unit reuses data;
* how it stores the research data according to the FAIR principles;
* how it makes its research data, methods and materials available.
