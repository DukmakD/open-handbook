### The Open Scholarship Knowledgebase (OSKB)

Resource guides on reproducibility: [oercommons.org/curated-collections/1038](http://oercommons.org/curated-collections/1038)

### Curated Reading List of Metascience

The Center for Open Science (COS) has compiled a list of papers related to the need for more transparent research and the effectiveness of such research practices. You can find the list on their [Open Science Literature page](https://osf.io/kgnva/wiki/Open%20Science%20Literature/). The list includes literature on the following aspects:

* Beneﬁts of transparency
* Data sharing policies and practices
* Reporting Standards, Guidelines, and Checklists
* Effects of preregistration or Registered Reports
* Questionable research practices
* The Reproducibility Crisis
* Evaluating Journals Policies
* Recommendations for Increasing Reproducibility
* Attitudes about open science

### Overcoming the Knowledge Barrier

On their page [Overcoming the Knowledge Barrier](osf.io/bk6r7/wiki](https://osf.io/bk6r7/wiki/home/), the Center for Open Science provides a lot of information to get started with an open and reproducible research practice. This page lists a lot of resources to get you up to speed with open science practices:

* Primers on implementing open science practices
* Tutorials and online curricula for coded statistical analysis
* Links to open science communities

### Center for Open Science content

* [Blog series](https://www.cos.io/blog)
* [Webinars](https://www.cos.io/events)
* [Resources for researchers](https://www.cos.io/communities/scientists-and-researchers)

### Preregistration

#### What is preregistration?

* It is the act of specifying in advance how data will be collected and analysed.
* Preregistrations are time-stamped, immutable documents.
* Preregistrations make the distinction between hypothesis testing, conﬁrmatory research and hypothesis generating, exploratory research more clear.
* Presenting exploratory results as conﬁrmatory increases the publish ability of results at the expense of credibility of results.

#### How to preregister?

The [Preregistration Challenge](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg-more-information) was an education campaign designed to introduce preregistration as a regular habit. It includes a guided workﬂow to help you create a preregistration.

See the [COS Preregistration page](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg) for more information about preregistration and start working on your own preregistration in [OSF Registries](https://osf.io/registries).

**Resources and Further Readings**

* *Can you preregister if you are using existing data?* Yes, see
  template available at [osf.io/registries](http://osf.io/registries)

## Connecting storage and apps

OSF allows you to connect to other storage platforms and services via Add-ons, see the [OSF Add-ons and integrations Guide](https://help.osf.io/article/395-storage-add-ons) for more information. Storage add-ons are particularly well suited for data sharing in a project. However, please consider the following when adding them to your project: what data (folders) is being shared, who this resource is being shared with and who manages the add-on (e.g. how long will it be available).

Recommended connected storage options are [Research Drive](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=39d345f097066990e553359fe153af01) ([how-to guide](https://osf.io/4ewgx/)) and [SURFdrive](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=fb4eda9f978f09d0e553359fe153afa5) ([how-to guide](https://osf.io/e9a5v/)). The VU discourages using Dropbox and Google Drive for storing research data.

For projects with a Code component creating connections to Github repos is a good idea, see the [OSF Guide](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019929813-Connect-GitHub-to-a-Project). If you just want to publish a Github repo itself consider using Zenodo, see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/).

You can also connect a dataset in [DataverseNL](https://dataverse.nl/) to your project, so published datasets can be viewed in OSF. You can even upload a delete file in Draft dataset ([how-to guide](https://osf.io/w2sme/)).

Remember, everyone who has access to your project will be able to see the files in the storage folder you connect, even if you have not explicitly shared the files on the source location!

Based on [VU minimal metadata guidelines](https://github.com/vu-rdm-tech/metadata/blob/main/minimal_metadata_guide.md) version rc2 2022-07-20

## Working with sensitive data

Actively choose \"Germany - Frankfurt\" in the account settings as default storage location when you start a new project. Your research data will be stored in the EU jurisdiction.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) via de SURFsecureID (with the tiqr app or a YubiKey) is enabled for all users who log in with VUnetID credentials for improved security and protection of your research data.

OSF has implemented several measures (e.g. OSF storage encryption, regular backups, Standard Contractual Clauses) to increase security of your stored research data as well as guarantee GDPR compliance.

The OSF is developed to facilitate Open Science and sharing of digital research objects. Medium-level sensitive data (e.g. unpublished research data, research proposals) can be stored provided it is available only to a specific group of users. VU does not advice to store privacy sensitive data. For this type of data please use a more suitable platform such as [ResearchDrive](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=39d345f097066990e553359fe153af01).
If there is no other suitable way to share a file with privacy sensitive data make sure you encrypt the file(s) before you upload them to the OSF, a good way to do this is by adding the files to a password protected zip file ([how-to guide](https://osf.io/fn9tx/)). Storing the highest (secret) level data (e.g. criminal records, classified information) is prohibited. Please contact the [RDM Support Desk](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=vu_research_dashboard_l1).

In case of a security incident or data leak, the data breach response [plan](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500011430761-COS-Data-Breach-Response-Plan) is available. Please report possible incidents via <support@osf.io> and always via IT Servicedesk: <servicedesk@vu.nl> or 020 598 0000.

More information on the OSF security policy and implemented measures can be found on [OSF Guide](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930993-FAQs-Security)

## Retaining access to your data when leaving the VU

If you want to retain access to your OSF Projects, you could create a new account with a personal email address. Then merge this account with your institutional account, see the [OSF Guide](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738014-Merge-Your-Accounts). Do this while your VUnetID is still active!

If your VUnetID has already expired, you can still create a new OSF account and ask a Project Admin to re-add you to the Projects.

If your VUnetID has expired and you are the only Project Admin please contact [OSF Support](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/requests/new).

### Deleting your account

You're always welcome to deactivate or delete your account. If you would like to delete your OSF account and personal data, please email <support@osf.io>.
