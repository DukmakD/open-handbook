## Offboarding

When leaving the VU, you are likely to leave behind project-related data. This data needs to be [archived](../topics/data-archiving) and be accesible by other researchers for verification of research data and to comply with regulations of funding organizations. Furthermore, researchers that remain at the VU may want to use your data in the future. To facilite this, we provide a template to fill out which can be handed over to your manager.

Furthermore, for removing data, it is important that it is clear which data can be removed. If this is not done, it remains unclear to your department/manager whether the data can be removed in accordance with agreements with science funders (e.g., NWO) and privacy laws (e.g., GDPR (EU) and AVG (NL)).

Note: this is a general template and the process may vary from department to department. Therefore, we recommend to check with your department if any department-specific workflows are in place.

## Data Removal

I declare that all important data was archived (see above), and my account and associated data can be removed on the following platforms[cite: 10]:

* [ ] SciStore
* [ ] SurfDrive
* [ ] Research Drive
* [ ] Yoda Active storage
* [ ] OneDrive
* [ ] Lab journals
* [ ] Other, namely â€¦.

A signed agreement for data removal is important to ensure data can be removed in accordance with agreements with science funders and privacy laws (e.g., GDPR and AVG)
