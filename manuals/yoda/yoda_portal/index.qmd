This page provides an overview of the Yoda functionality you can access through the [Yoda Web Portal](https://portal.yoda.vu.nl).

## Overview of the Yoda Web Portal

### Group Manager
Yoda allows you to store your valuable research data in a secure way.  The data is kept in data folders,
which can only be accessed by members of the associated research Group.

The Group Manager can be used to view a list of research Groups and their members. People with a "group manager" role
can add members to a research Group, remove them, and change their roles.

See: [Managing groups, users and access rights](./yoda_group_manager.qmd)

### Your data in the Yoda Portal
Each group in Yoda has access to two main data folders:

#### Research
The main folder ("research-...") contains current research data that researchers
collaborate on. Data is kept in subfolders. The subfolders can be organized according
to the needs of the research Group.

You can also drag-and-drop files to your research folder or download individual files.

#### Archiving
When you know a (subset of) your data must be [archived](/topics/data-archiving.qmd) for the long term, the data in a subfolder can be deposited so that it is
kept for 10 years or longer. 

Use the "Submit" button to deposit the subfolder containing your dataset. This will
copy the contents of the subfolder to the Vault folder as a new data package.

Before doing so, the subfolder must be described with metadata, which can be entered via a form. 

For more information on metadata in Yoda see: [Adding metadata](./yoda_metadata.qmd).

#### Vault
The folder named "vault-..." contains these deposited data packages. The research Group has read access to datasets in the Vault folder.

Once deposited, data cannot be removed. Therefore the vault can be used to account for data
in a research project to comply with FAIR principles.

#### Publishing
Researchers can opt to (but do not have to) [publish](/topics/data-publishing.qmd) any of the vault deposited data packages
to make the metadata description of a data package known to the research community at large.

Yoda adds a DOI persistent identifier to published data so that the data package can be cited
and found in catalogs such as Datacite, Narcis, B2Find etcetera.

If (and only if) the data has been classified as "open" then the content itself can be downloaded
by anyone from the internet. Otherwise, only the metadata description can be viewed.
